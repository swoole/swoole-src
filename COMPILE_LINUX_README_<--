Go in parent directory, open  a new sudo gedit using terminal, then type save / run 

sudo apt-get install php7-dev
git clone https://github.com/iPolitic/swoole-src.git
cd swoole-src
phpize
./configure --with-php-config=/usr/local/php7/bin/php-config

make && make install

save as INSTALL_Swoole.sh

then in terminal run : sudo bash ./INSTALL_Swoole.sh 

At the end of the setup, you should get a messge about where the .so was created, be sure that it match the phpinfo()'s dir path. Else move it.
