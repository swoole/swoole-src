# Swoole Changelog

## 2024-12-16 v6.0.0
# ‚ú® New Feature:
- Added multi-threading support, require the ZTS version of PHP. Add `--enable-swoole-thread` option to the configure command to activate it.
- Added a new thread class `Swoole\Thread`. @matyhtf
- Introduced thread lock `Swoole\Thread\Lock`. @matyhtf
- Added thread atomic counter `Swoole\Thread\Atomic`, `Swoole\Thread\Atomic\Long`. @matyhtf
- Added safe concurrent containers `Swoole\Thread\Map`, `Swoole\Thread\ArrayList`, `Swoole\Thread\Queue`. @matyhtf
- The file asynchronous operation supports using `io_uring` as the underlying engine for file asynchronous operations. When liburing is installed and Swoole is compiled with the --enable-iouring option, the asynchronous operations of functions such as file_get_contents, file_put_contents, fopen, fclose, fread, fwrite, mkdir, unlink, fsync, fdatasync, rename, fstat, lstat, and filesize will be implemented by io_uring. @matyhtf @NathanFreeman
- Upgraded `Boost Context` to version 1.84. Now, Loongson CPUs can also support coroutines. @NathanFreeman
- Added `Swoole\Thread\Map::find()` method. @matyhtf
- Added `Swoole\Thread\ArrayList::find()` method. @matyhtf
- Added `Swoole\Thread\ArrayList::offsetUnset()` method. @matyhtf
- Added `Swoole\Process::getAffinity()` method. @matyhtf
- Added `Swoole\Thread::setName()` method. @matyhtf
- Added `Swoole\Thread::setAffinity()` method. @matyhtf
- Added `Swoole\Thread::getAffinity()` method. @matyhtf
- Added `Swoole\Thread::setPriority()` method. @matyhtf
- Added `Swoole\Thread::getPriority()` method. @matyhtf
- Added `Swoole\Thread::gettid()` method.
- The file asynchronous engine `iouring` supports multi-threaded polling mode `IORING_SETUP_SQPOLL`. @NathanFreeman
- Added `iouring_workers` to modify the number of `iouring` threads. @NathanFreeman
- Added `iouring_flags` to support modifying the `iouring` working mode. @NathanFreeman
- Added `Swoole\Thread\Barrier` for multi-thread synchronization barrier. @matyhtf
- Added new function and class to set cookies. @matyhtf @NathanFreeman
- Added `non-blocking, reentrant coroutine mutex lock`, which can be used between processes/threads without blocking them. @NathanFreeman
- `Swoole\Coroutine\Socket::getOption()` supports the `TCP_INFO` option. @matyhtf
- `Swoole\Client` synchronous blocking client supports `http` proxy. @matyhtf
- Added asynchronous non-blocking `TCP/UDP/Unix socket` client `Swoole\Async\Client`. @matyhtf
- Optimized the `Swoole\Redis\Server::format()` method to support zero-copy memory, support `redis` nested structure. @matyhtf
- Supports the high-performance compression tool `Zstd`. You only need to add `--enable-zstd` when compiling `Swoole`, and then `zstd` can be used to compress or decode responses between the `http` client and server. @NathanFreeman
