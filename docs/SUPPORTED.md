- **Security fixes only**:  A release that is supported for critical security issues only. Releases are only made on an as-needed basis.

## PHP Version Support

1. Each branch (`MINOR version`) supports a fixed range of PHP versions. The `RELEASE VERSIONS` for that branch will not increase support for higher PHP versions.
2. The upper limit is four PHP versions; any additional versions will not be supported. For example, version 6.0 only supports PHP 8.1 to 8.4.
3. No support for any DEV or RC stage of PHP

The pace of PHP version updates is rapid, with each version introducing numerous underlying changes. The developers of Swoole have had to invest significant time and effort to support new releases, and we lack sufficient resources to keep up with PHP updates. Therefore, there will be a delay of one MINOR version before supporting new PHP versions.


## Unsupported Branches

> These releases that are no longer supported. Users of this release should upgrade as soon as possible, as they may be exposed to unpatched security vulnerabilities.
